Project 2: Use the ADT stack to process algebraic expressions 
and implement the ADT stack by using a resizable array, linked
chain, and a vector. 

----RUN IN AN IDE----
The java files in the zip file should be copied and run in an IDE. 
The BookArray, LinkedBookStack and VectorStack classes
all implement StackInterface. The driver for BookArray is 
ArrayDriver.java, the driver for LinkedBookStack is NodeDriver.java, 
and the driver for VectorStack is VectorDriver.java.
